/**
 * Trail just for one person in a repo.
 *
 * `trail init` asks who trail is for in a repo whose team hasn't committed
 * `.trail/`. "Just me" means git sees nothing of trail's there: `.trail/` goes
 * in the clone's own `.git/info/exclude`, `.claude/settings.json` is left out
 * (the hooks in `~/.claude` run trail), every learning is saved in ~/.trail,
 * and nothing asks the person to commit or share. `trail init --team` turns
 * it off, and the person commits `.trail/` then.
 *
 * The mark sits in the repo's folder in ~/.trail, so every clone and worktree
 * of the repo reads the same answer.
