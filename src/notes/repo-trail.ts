 * plain markdown that reads fine without trail installed.
 *
 * Teammates' learnings arrive two ways: merged into the default branch, which

 * and which files each pushed branch changes, come from a cache that a
 * background `git fetch` refreshes (branches.ts), so nothing here spawns git.

What coding sessions on this repo worked out, kept next to the code so the

               what it took to work out

Learnings are short summaries, never transcripts. Commit them with the change
they came from. Claude Code reads them through the trail skill
(\`.claude/skills/trail/\`); without trail installed they are plain markdown.
