/**
 * Learnings: one short note per coding session that took real digging.
 *
 * A learning is what a session worked out that the code itself doesn't say:
 * what was decided, what was tried and ruled out, and what to watch out for,
 * plus what it cost to figure out. The next session on the same code reads it
 * before exploring, so nobody pays for it twice.
 *
 * Most learnings are about the code, so they go in the repo's `.trail/learnings/`
 * and are committed with the change (repo-trail.ts): every teammate's agent
 * starts from them, and teammates' pushed branches bring theirs before they
 * merge (branches.ts). A personal one, about one person's setup or habits,
 * stays on their machine in `~/.trail/repos/<repo>/notes/` (home.ts).
 *
 * One file per session and never edited after it's written. A summary only,
 * never a transcript: the agent writes the body, and nothing here reads
 * source files or prompts into it.
