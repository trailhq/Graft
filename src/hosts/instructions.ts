This repo is indexed in \`graft/\`: small linked markdown nodes that explain each
system and carry exact file:line spans, kept in sync with the code through git.

For ANY task here — understanding how something works, finding where code lives,
or scoping a change — get context from the graph before grepping or opening
source files. Re-ask freely (it's cheap) and reuse literal identifiers you
already have (symbol, error string, file name) as the query. New to this repo?
Run \`graft map\` first — a token-budgeted orientation (dir clusters, hubs,
hotspots), no LLM, no key.

- Run \`graft ask "<your question>" --source\` → ranked nodes with the relevant
  code spans inlined (each hit's ≤8-line crux by default; \`--full\` for whole
  definitions when the crux isn't enough). Match the tool to the task shape:
  for understanding or editing, the top node IS the answer — cite its
  \`covers:\` file:line spans and edit straight from \`--source\`. For
  exhaustive tasks ("every occurrence / every caller of this pattern"), ranked
  results are top-N, not complete — run \`graft grep "<literal>"\` instead
  (exhaustive over indexed files, grouped by enclosing symbol), falling back
  to raw \`grep -rn\` only for unindexed files.
- \`graft skeleton <file>\` → every definition's signature + span, ~10× cheaper
  than reading the file; use it to skim an API surface.
- \`graft callers <symbol>\` gives precomputed, exact edges — who calls this.
  Add \`--direction out\` for what it calls, or \`--depth N\` to walk
  transitively for the full blast radius. For structural questions, skip
  ranking and use this directly.
- Or browse: \`graft/INDEX.md\` lists every node; follow the links.
- Monorepos and folders of multiple repos rank fairly across sub-projects —
  hits carry \`[scope/]\` labels naming which one they're from. Narrow with
  \`graft ask "<task>" --in <scope>/\` once you know where you're working.
  For compound-path repos (e.g. \`default-core/frontend\`) use the full path —
  a partial first segment (\`--in default-core\`) is not a valid scope.

If a returned span is truncated ("+N more lines"), open the file at that exact
range before finalizing. Only open source files when a node genuinely lacks a
needed detail, and then at the exact file:line the node points to — never
re-read whole files.

After big code changes, refresh the graph with \`graft build\` (deterministic,
no API key, $0).

## Checklist before committing / pushing / opening a PR

Run **in this order** before the first push on any branch:

\`\`\`bash
tsc -b                                   # types (includes test files — do NOT use --noEmit)
<lint>                                   # e.g. bun run lint / npm run lint
<tests>                                  # e.g. npx vitest run <module>
graft check --base origin/<base-branch>  # blast radius: conflicts with other branches + learnings
\`\`\`

> **\`tsc -b\` vs \`--noEmit\`**: CI uses \`tsc -b\`, which compiles test files too.
> \`--noEmit\` locally can pass clean even when CI fails (test fixtures not checked).

\`graft check\` goes **last**, before the push — not after opening the PR.
If it surfaces overlap with another active branch, mention it in the MR/PR description.`;
