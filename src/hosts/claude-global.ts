/**
 * User-level install for Claude Code: the copy of graft's wiring that lives
 * outside every repo.
 *
 * Why this exists. Everything `graft init` writes for Claude Code lands *in* the
 * repo — `.mcp.json` and `.claude/settings.json`. A `.gitignore` is free to ignore
 * both, and `git worktree add` checks out tracked files only, so a worktree of such
 * a repo starts with graft's shims present and neither of the two files that *point
 * at* them. No settings.json means no SessionStart hook; no `.mcp.json` means no
 * tool server. graft is absent, silently, in a tree that looks correctly wired.
 *
 * graft already carries the repair for exactly that — `reconcileWiring` rewrites
 * both files — and it is unreachable here: `runUpkeep` is called only from the hook
 * and from the MCP server, which are the two things that are missing. Seeding can't
 * help either, since it runs on the query path, which needs the server.
 *
 * So the fix cannot live in the repo. `~/.claude/` is not in anyone's working tree,
 * no `.gitignore` reaches it, and Claude Code reads it for every project — worktrees
 * included. Codex has been installed this way from the start (see ./codex-hooks.ts,
 * whose own note says the entries "fire in every repo opened with Codex, not just
 * this one"); Claude Code was the one host graft wired repo-only. This module closes
 * that gap, and is a deliberate mirror of that file.
 *
 * The repo-level writes stay exactly as they were. A project that has its own
 * `.mcp.json` and settings keeps using them; this is the floor underneath, not a
 * replacement.
