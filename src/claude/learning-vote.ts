/**
 * "Did it help? yes/no", asked once a session after a learning is reused.
 *
 * Reuse is the credit line: when a learning shapes a reply, the agent closes
 * it with "📝 Started from Maya's learning" (format.ts asks for that). Until
 * the session has asked, that ask also has the agent end the line with
 * {@link VOTE_ASK}, so the question costs no extra turn and never stops the
 * work. The Stop hook sees the question in the reply's last words and marks a
 * vote pending; the person's next prompt settles it: yes (or 👍, +1) is `up`,
 * no (or 👎, -1) is `down`, anything else is `none`, and the prompt goes on as usual.
 * One `learning_rated` event carries the vote and the learning's id. Nothing
 * the person typed is kept or sent.
