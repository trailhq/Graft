/**
 * Session usage accounting, shared across every host (Claude Code, Cursor, and
 * plain MCP). It answers the one question the README rests on: when an agent had
 * both graft and grep in front of it, which did it reach for, and how much did
 * that save?
 *
 * The counters (`graftReads`, `sourceReads`, `savedTokens`) already live on
 * {@link SessionState}; before this module nothing ever incremented the first
 * two, so `session_summary` telemetry shipped 0/0 for every session. Everything
 * here is a pure classify + read-modify-write over `graft/.cache/session/`, so a
 * host adapter is a few lines: parse its payload, call {@link recordToolUse}.
 *
 * Two payload shapes feed it, confirmed against the vendor docs rather than
 * guessed (the matcher depends on getting the names right):
 *
 *   - Claude Code `PostToolUse`  — `{ tool_name, tool_input: { command }, tool_response }`.
 *     A graft retrieval prints a `[graft] tokens saved ≈ N` footer into
 *     `tool_response`, which is itself proof graft ran.
 *   - Cursor `postToolUse`       — `{ tool_name, tool_input, tool_output, conversation_id }`
 *     (https://cursor.com/docs/hooks). `tool_output` is the JSON-stringified
 *     result; a Shell `graft …` call carries the same footer inside its stdout.
 *   - Cursor `afterMCPExecution` — `{ tool_name, tool_input, result_json, duration }`.
 *     Fires only for MCP tools, so a graft tool is recognised by its name and
 *     its savings read out of `result_json`.
 *
 * MCP tool names arrive host-prefixed in different shapes (`graft_find_code`,
 * `MCP:graft_find_code`, `mcp__graft__graft_find_code`). {@link isGraftMcpTool}
 * strips the prefix to the last delimited segment and checks it against the real
 * name list (`GRAFT_MCP_TOOL_NAMES`), so a graft tool is recognised across every
 * host format while a third-party tool that merely contains "graft" is not.
