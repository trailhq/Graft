/**
 * Did the agent actually TELL the user what graft saved?
 *
 * `savedTokens` (state.ts) counts what graft *computed* — every
 * `[graft] tokens saved ≈ N` footer the PostToolUse accumulator swept up. That
 * number is real whether or not anyone sees it. This module measures the other
 * half: whether the reply the user read closed with the one-line tally that
 * SKILL.md and `savingsTurnNudge` (context/savings.ts) both ask for. A turn
 * that saved 20k tokens in silence is a turn where the product did its job and
 * got no credit for it, and the two are indistinguishable in the numbers we
 * ship today.
 *
 * The assistant's own prose exists in exactly one place a hook can reach: the
 * host's transcript JSONL, named on the Stop hook's stdin as `transcript_path`.
 * So this reads that file — locally, at turn end, for a boolean. Nothing out of
 * it is stored or sent; the session keeps a count and the telemetry contract
 * carries that count as a bucket. See TELEMETRY.md.
 *
 * Only what the transcript gained since the last Stop is read (a transcript
 * grows for the life of a session; a real one passed 233 MB), through the
 * trace layer's cursor, and what has to outlive one read (the reply in
 * progress, the responses already billed) rides in that cursor's memo.

 * phrasing from the example would measure the agent's formatting rather than
 * whether the user was told. Anchored on "graft saved" + a number + "tokens" so
