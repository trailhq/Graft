/**
 * Keeps the workspace's copy of a repo's learnings, and its record of how
 * they're used, in step with this machine.
 *
 * What goes up for a repo in the workspace is every learning in its `.trail/`
 * that git has: the ones committed at HEAD and the ones on teammates' pushed
 * branches, after a `git fetch`. Never an uncommitted edit or an untracked
 * file. Not just this person's, so one person is enough to cover a repo.
 * Personal learnings in ~/.trail never go up.
 *
 * Uses (a search that showed learnings, a check against them) are appended to
 * `~/.trail/outbox.jsonl` as they happen, and sent with the next sync. That's
 * how a teammate's reuse of a learning shows on the team page. A use is counts
 * and the names of the learnings shown: never what someone typed, never the
 * files they're in. And only names the workspace already has: a learning's
 * file name carries the first words of its title, so a personal learning, or
 * one git doesn't have yet, is left out. Only while the machine is connected,
 * and only for a repo in the workspace: nobody agreed to send even that for a
 * repo they didn't pick, or from before they signed in.
 *
 * Commands never wait on any of this: when something changed, a detached
 * `_trail-sync` child does it.
