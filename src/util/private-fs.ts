/**
 * The one way the skills code writes under `~/.trail`: files 0600 (a copied
 * helper script 0700), folders 0700, whole files by temp file and rename,
 * log lines by one O_APPEND write, and a lock that gives up.
 *
 * The lock gives up rather than waits forever or barges in: a hook that can't
 * get it in time does nothing, because a fold that ran twice would count
 * every call twice, and a lost update is better than a double one. A lock
 * older than 10 s belongs to a process that died, so it is taken over, by one
 * process at a time (a second lock, held for microseconds, guards the
 * takeover), and a holder only ever removes its own lock.
 *
 * Nothing here writes through a symlink: an append refuses one, and a whole
 * file replaces the link itself, never what it points to.
