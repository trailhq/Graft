const SYSTEM_PROMPT = `You build an ARCHITECTURE graph of a codebase from per-file summaries. The reader is an AI agent that will read this graph before working on the code, so it must describe the system at the level a senior engineer would explain it — not file by file.

Produce a CURATED set of nodes of mixed granularity:
- "system" nodes: GROUP files that collaborate as one component (usually a directory or a cohesive set) into a SINGLE node. This should be the most common node type. Prefer one system node over several file nodes.
- "file" nodes: only for a substantial, standalone module that genuinely deserves its own node apart from its system.
- "concept" nodes: cross-cutting ideas, design decisions, or invariants that span multiple files (e.g. "local-first provider fallback", "staleness checking", "content-hash provenance"). Include several — they are the most valuable nodes for an agent.

Rules:
- Every summary must earn its tokens with NON-OBVIOUS information: invariants, ordering constraints, conventions, failure modes, "X must never happen after Y" facts, and the WHY behind a design. Never restate what a README says or what a directory listing already makes obvious ("src/api contains the API code" is worthless); an agent reading the node already sees the file paths. If all you can say about a group of files is what their names say, fold them into a larger node instead.
- Strongly prefer FEWER, larger, meaningful nodes. For a repo of N files, aim for well under N nodes. Do NOT emit one node per file, and never a node per incidental identifier (a local interface, helper, or third-party symbol).
- Merge duplicates and surface-form variants into one node.
- For each node give: a canonical human-readable name; a type ("system" | "file" | "concept"); a 1-3 sentence summary of its ROLE in the system; "sources" = the exact file paths (from the input) it is grounded in (a system lists all its files; a concept lists the files that motivate it); and "links" to other nodes you define, each with a relation and a short description of what concretely happens in the code.
- The relation MUST be one of exactly these verbs (each answers a question a code reviewer asks): "part_of" (where does this live?), "uses" (what breaks if the target changes?), "depends_on" (same, for non-call dependencies), "produces" (where does this output come from?), "configures" (what changes its behavior without a code change?), "validates" (what checks or judges this? tests, drift checks, scoring), "implements" (what contract must this honor?). Never invent vague relations like "influences", "supports", or "relates_to" — if none of the verbs fit, drop the link.
- Only link to nodes you actually define in this response.
