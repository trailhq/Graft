 * because agents, hooks, CI scripts and statusline parsers already read it.
 * Nothing about graft is ever removed — see `graftNotice` for the one line a
 * person typing it sees.
 *
 * The name travels in an environment variable rather than a module variable so
 * that every child this process spawns (the detached update check, a hook's
 * background build) speaks the same name as its parent. Unset means graft: the
 * only things that load `dist/cli.js` without going through `dist/bin/*` are
 * shims and configs an older graft wrote.
 *
 * This file imports nothing heavier than node:fs, because the hooks load it.
