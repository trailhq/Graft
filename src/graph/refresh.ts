/**
 * `ensureFreshGraph` — the pre-query gate that keeps retrieval honest.
 *
 * Freshness used to be someone else's job: the Claude Code `Stop` hook spawned a
 * background `graft build` *after* the turn ended, so every query an agent made
 * between its first edit and the end of the turn answered from a graph that no
 * longer matched the file it had just changed. Worse, an edit made outside the
 * agent (your editor, a branch switch, a stash) set no `dirty` flag at all, so
 * nothing ever triggered a resync.
 *
 * So freshness moves into the query path: every retrieval call probes the working
 * tree (`fingerprint.ts`, ~3ms) and, when something moved, rebuilds the structural
 * graph before answering. Properties worth keeping:
 *
 * - **$0 and offline.** Tier-1 only — never a summarizer, never `--deep`. Same
 *   money guard `claude/sync-run.ts` carries: auto-anything must not spend money.
 * - **Never fatal.** A failed refresh degrades to answering from the graph on
 *   disk. A query that works today must not start failing because a rebuild did.
 * - **Never a stampede.** It takes the same `graft/.cache/.sync.lock` the
 *   background sync uses, so concurrent MCP calls and the Stop hook can't pile up
 *   rebuilds on top of each other.
 * - **Writes only what a query reads** (`graphOnly`): the graph, the `ask` sidecar,
 *   the freshness record. Not the markdown cards, not `INDEX.md`, not `.gitignore`.
 *   Those belong to an explicit `graft build` — which the `Stop` hook already runs
 *   at the end of a turn — so retrieval stays cheap and a read stays a read. It
 *   also leaves `stats.json` alone, so that same `Stop` hook still sees `dirty` and
 *   still rebuilds the passive surface.
 *
 * One case is not drift but absence: inside a git worktree there is no graph at all,
 * because `graft/` is gitignored and so was never checked out. The gate covers that
 * too — it copies the parent checkout's graph in (`./seed.ts`) and then treats the
 * difference between the two checkouts as ordinary drift, which is exactly what it is.
