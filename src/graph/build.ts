/**
 * `graph` — build `.context/graph.json` from a code repository.
 *
 * M1 pipeline (Tier-1 only, deterministic, no LLM):
 *   1. Walk the repo for TS/Python source files.
 *   2. Parse each with tree-sitter and emit one NodeV1 per definition.
 *   3. Write a sorted graph.json.
 * Edges (M2) and LLM summary/crux (M3) layer onto this without changing it.
 *
 * Step 2 is memoized per file (`extract-cache.ts`): a file whose bytes haven't
 * moved replays its last parse instead of re-running tree-sitter, so a rebuild
 * costs ~the files that changed. Everything after extraction still runs over the
 * whole node set, so an incremental build's output is byte-identical to a cold
 * one — the invariant `test/graph-incremental.test.ts` pins down.
