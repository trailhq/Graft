/**
 * Container tier — files that are not a language but a wrapper around one.
 *
 * A Vue SFC is the motivating case: `.vue` is HTML-shaped, and everything worth
 * indexing lives inside its `<script>` block. Registering `tree-sitter-vue` as a
 * breadth-tier language (generic.ts) would not help — that grammar parses the
 * shell (`<template>` / `<script>` / `<style>`) and hands back the script body as
 * one opaque `raw_text` node, so the cards would come out empty.
 *
 * Astro's `---` frontmatter is the same shape with a different fence: the
 * grammar hands back one `frontmatter_js_block` holding TypeScript.
 *
 * So the container grammar is used only to answer "where does the embedded
 * language start and end", and the block itself goes to the DEPTH-tier extractor
 * (extract.ts). A `.vue` file therefore gets the same quality of extraction as a
 * `.ts` file — bindings, imports, resolved calls — not the signature-only output
 * the breadth tier would give.
 *
 * **The span shift is the whole risk here.** `extractFile` numbers its spans from
 * the start of the string it was handed, so every node comes back pointing at a
 * line in the script, not in the `.vue`. A span that is off by even one line is
 * worse than not indexing the file at all: graft's promise is that its
 * `file:line` is exact, and a plausible-but-wrong line silently sends the reader
 * to the wrong place. `test/container-extract.test.ts` pins this against
 * fixtures whose true line numbers are known.
