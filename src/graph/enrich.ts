/**
 * Tier-2 pass: attach the LLM meaning layer (`summary` + `crux`) to nodes.
 *
 * graph.json is its own cache — the committed file already holds every node's
 * summary/crux from a prior run. So this pass is diff-driven:
 *
 *   - cache hit  — a prior node with the same id, same `body_hash`, and
 *     `summary_state:"ready"` → carry its summary/crux over, no LLM call.
 *   - stale      — a prior ready summary whose body has since changed → keep the
 *     old text as a hint but mark it "stale". Recomputed only if an LLM is given.
 *   - pending    — new or never-summarized node → one LLM call when an LLM is
 *     given, otherwise left "pending".
 *
 * Passing no summarizer runs the cache/stale bookkeeping alone (no calls, no
 * cost) — which is what a plain `graph` build does, so it never wipes the
 * meaning layer a previous `--llm` run produced.
 *
 * The LLM returns line numbers into the slice it was shown; we consume them here,
 * once, to cut `crux.code` verbatim from the source. `crux.span` is a pointer
 * only and is never used to re-slice.
