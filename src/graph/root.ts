/**
 * Where "here" is when a query names no directory. An agent session — or a plain
 * shell — started in a subdirectory of an indexed repo should still find the
 * graph, so the implicit root is the nearest ANCESTOR holding a graft index:
 * either a repo's own wiring graph (`graft/.graph/wiring.json`) or a workspace
 * parent's children index (`graft/workspace.json`). Nothing indexed anywhere
 * above → the start dir itself, so `graft build` in a fresh repo still means
 * "here" and no command silently retargets a sibling tree.
 *
 * Only the IMPLICIT case walks. An explicit `[dir]` argument is taken at face
 * value, and a `--dir` override short-circuits entirely: `contextDirFor` returns
 * an override verbatim and ignores the root it is handed, so every ancestor
 * would report the same context dir and the walk would answer "level 0" for a
 * dir that isn't the repo.
