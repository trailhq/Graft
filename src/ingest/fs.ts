 *
 *   - `followSubmodules` follows a GITLINK — an index entry with mode `160000`,
 *     a commit the superproject versions.
 *   - `followNestedRepos` follows a nested clone the parent's index knows
 *     nothing about. Manifest-driven multi-repo tools (west, repo, gclient,
 *     tsrc, mr, …) all check dependencies out this way, and so does anyone who
 *     clones an upstream into the tree to patch it locally.
 *
 * Both default to false, preserving the historical superproject boundary. Each

 * nested clones remain absent either way (`--exclude-standard` never emits
