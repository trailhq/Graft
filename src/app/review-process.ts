/**
 * Running a review somewhere it cannot stop the App answering.
 *
 * A review is synchronous from end to end, and not in one place we could fix: the
 * pull request is fetched with `spawnSync` (`./checkout.ts`), the whole repository
 * is parsed in one `files.forEach` loop of native tree-sitter calls
 * (`graph/build.ts`), the graph is written with a blocking `JSON.stringify`, and
 * the viewer page is exported synchronously too. In-process that holds the event
 * loop for the entire review.
 *
 * That is not a theory. On the deployed App, probing `GET /p/<id>` from outside
 * every ten seconds while one review ran: three consecutive timeouts (no response
 * at all, not even with `--max-time 45`), then 404 in 0.9s the moment the queue
 * emptied. Meanwhile the box's load average was 0.96 on eight vCPUs — one thread
 * pegged, seven cores idle — and the App's own logs put a single review at 92s to
 * 274s ("3 changed → 0 affected in 180134ms"). So a *single* in-flight review took
 * the whole HTTP surface down for minutes: the container's 5s `HEALTHCHECK` failed,
 * Docker marked the container unhealthy, and pages the App had already produced
 * were unreachable. On a busy repository that is most of the working day.
 *
 * Neither bounding the queue nor lowering `GRAFT_CONCURRENCY` touches this —
 * concurrency was already 2 and one job is enough. Cooperative yielding inside the
 * parse loop does not either: a `git fetch` of a large repository is one
 * uninterruptible `spawnSync` that can legitimately take a minute, and it is not
 * even using a core while it blocks. The work has to leave the process.
 *
 * A child process rather than a `worker_threads` worker, deliberately:
 *
 *  - **The native grammars keep loading the way they already do.** `graph/extract.ts`
 *    imports nine tree-sitter addons at module scope and constructs a `Parser` there
 *    too, and `graph/generic.ts` loads more through `createRequire`. In a worker all
 *    of that is re-instantiated per thread, which puts the N-API-in-worker behaviour
 *    of nine third-party native modules between the App and every review. A fork runs
 *    byte-identical code to what production runs today.
 *  - **A review can be killed.** A wedged parse or a 10-minute clone is a process
 *    to SIGKILL, not a thread with no safe way to stop it.
 *  - **A crash stops being an outage.** An OOM kill or a grammar segfault on a
 *    stranger's source now costs one review and is reported as a failure, instead
 *    of taking the HTTP server with it. This process clones code written by
 *    people who opened a pull request; that isolation is worth having on its own.
 *  - **The heap goes away.** A repository's graph is freed by the child exiting
 *    rather than left for the server process to fragment around.
 *
 * The parent keeps exactly the two things a review cannot mint for itself, and
 * hands each across the IPC channel rather than argv or the environment (`ps` and
 * `/proc/<pid>/environ` are readable; an installation token belongs in neither):
 * the token, so the App's private key never crosses the boundary, and page
 * publishing, because the store and the secret it signs URLs with live with the
 * server.
