/**
 * Naming the clusters a diff reaches — the rung of the ladder between a concept
 * node and the symbol backstop (see {@link LabelSource}).
 *
 * The point is scope. Getting labels from `build --deep` means summarising every
 * file in the repo — 356 calls and thirteen minutes on graft's own repo — to put
 * names on the six clusters a PR actually touches, and it still misses: only 40% of
 * this repo's files are claimed by a concept, so the rest fall back to a path. Here
 * the unit of work is the cluster, not the file: one request names all of them from
 * data the graph already holds (paths and symbol names — no file reads), and the
 * answer is cached by content hash so the next PR pays nothing for a cluster whose
 * files did not change.
 *
 * Two rules keep it honest:
 *   - a cluster spanning unrelated features must come back "mixed", and then keeps
 *     its symbol backstop rather than a flattering name;
 *   - a failure of any kind — no key, spent quota, refused call, malformed answer —
 *     leaves every label exactly as it was and never fails the caller.

Rules:
- 2 to 4 words, Title Case. No trailing "Module", "System", "Layer", "Manager" or "Handler" unless the team would genuinely say it.
- Name the RESPONSIBILITY, not the mechanics: "Query Freshness Gate", "Workspace Federation", "Asset Bundling". Never restate a path or a directory name, and never name it after the language or the file type.
- If the files in a cluster serve two or more unrelated responsibilities, answer exactly "mixed" for that cluster. A wrong name is worse than no name, because a reviewer will trust it.
- Answer for every cluster key you are given, and invent no other keys.`;
