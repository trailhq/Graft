/**
 * Who to tag on a pull request: the people whose fingerprints are on the areas
 * this diff changes or can affect.
 *
 * The blast report already answers "what does this reach"; the author's next
 * question is "who do I ask about it", and git has the answer without a single
 * API call. One `git log` per area over that area's OWN files, scored by recency,
 * ranked, capped.
 *
 * Two rules keep the output honest, and both exist because a wrong name here is
 * worse than no name:
 *
 *  - A handle is only ever printed when git actually carries one (the GitHub
 *    noreply address, which anything merged through the web UI has). With no
 *    handle the display name is printed unlinked — a guessed `@mention` pings a
 *    stranger, and there is no cheap way to verify a guess.
 *  - An owner has to hold {@link MIN_SHARE} of an area's weight to be named. That
 *    drops a drive-by typo fix next to a real owner, and keeps it when the
 *    drive-by is all the history there is.
 *
 * Everything here is best-effort: no git, no repository, a detached tarball
 * checkout or a shallow clone leaves the report exactly as it was and the comment
 * simply says nothing about people.
