/**
 * Getting a brain without leaving the terminal.
 *
 * Until now a brain could only begin in the browser. You signed up on Trail, it
 * created the brain, and handed you a `graft init --trail <id>:<token>` line to
 * paste. That is the right way round when the website is where you already are,
 * and the wrong way round when you are standing in a repository with graft
 * already installed — which is where most people meet graft first.
 *
 * So `graft trail push` on an unlinked repo starts here instead of stopping.
 * Graft opens a listener on loopback, sends the browser to Trail carrying the
 * repository it is standing in and the port to answer on, and waits. Trail does
 * the signing up, makes a brain for that repository, and redirects back to the
 * listener with the brain id and its read token. The push then carries on as if
 * the repo had been linked all along.
 *
 * Two things keep that safe. The listener binds to 127.0.0.1, so nothing off
 * this machine can reach it. And it accepts only a handoff echoing the random
 * state it just generated, so some other page the user happens to have open
 * cannot push a brain of its own choosing into their repository.
