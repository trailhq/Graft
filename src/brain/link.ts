/**
 * The link between a repo's graft graph and a Trail brain.
 *
 * A brain holds the rules mined out of this repository's history — what the
 * team decided and why, which the code graph cannot see. Graft holds the code
 * and can say which symbols an answer touches. This module is the join: the
 * token identifying the brain, and the rules cached beside it so `ask` never
 * waits on the network.
 *
 * The link lives in the per-repo, git-ignored `.graft/config.json`, next to the
 * other persisted build choices. Not in `~/.graft/`: a brain belongs to one
 * repository, and two checkouts of different repos on one machine must not
 * share one.
