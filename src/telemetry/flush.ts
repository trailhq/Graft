/**
 * Getting the queue off the machine without any command ever waiting for it.
 *
 * Deliberately the same shape as `maybeRefreshInBackground` in `upkeep.ts`,
 * which has been doing this for the npm registry check since 0.7: check a
 * timestamp, write the timestamp BEFORE spawning so a child that dies cannot
 * make every subsequent command spawn another one, then `spawn` detached and
 * `unref`. The parent returns immediately and never learns the outcome.
 *
 * Once a day, not once a command. Events are cheap to hold and the questions we
 * are asking ("how many repos activated this week") do not get better answers
 * from lower latency.
