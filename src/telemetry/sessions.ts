/**
 * Rolling a finished agent session up into one `session_summary` event.
 *
 * This is the event that justifies the whole exercise. Everything else here
 * counts commands; this one answers the question the product actually rests on —
 * when an agent had both graft and grep available, which did it reach for, and
 * how many tokens did that save? The counters already exist: the Claude Code
 * hooks have been writing `graftReads`, `sourceReads` and `savedTokens` per
 * session into `graft/.cache/session/` since well before telemetry did. Nothing
 * new is measured here; a closed session is simply bucketed and queued.
 *
 * "Closed" is inferred from mtime by the idle sweep ({@link flushClosedSessions})
 * because Claude Code has no reliable end-of-session hook — `Stop` fires per
 * turn, and an editor that crashes fires nothing at all. A session untouched for
 * two hours is over. Cursor DOES have `sessionEnd`, so it force-closes the exact
 * conversation that just ended via {@link summarizeSession}, skipping the idle
 * gate that would otherwise ignore the file the last tool use just wrote.
 *
 * Called from the session-start hook (the sweep) and the Cursor sessionEnd hook
 * (the force-close) — both places guaranteed to run at the right moment. A hook
 * must never touch the network (see the note atop upkeep.ts) and this doesn't:
 * it only appends to the local queue.
