/**
 * `track()` — the only way an event is ever created, and the place the contract
 * is enforced.
 *
 * Call sites pass a name and some properties; this drops anything the contract
 * (contract.ts) does not list, stamps the common properties, and appends to the
 * local queue. It never sends, never blocks, and never throws — a telemetry bug
 * must be incapable of failing a build or a query.
 *
 * Two rules do the actual privacy work, and both are enforced here rather than
 * asked of callers:
 *
 *   • unknown event → dropped whole; unknown property key → dropped, the rest of
 *     the event survives. A careless `track('query', { path })` sends `query`
 *     without a path.
 *   • non-string values → dropped. Everything that crosses the wire is a bucket
 *     label or an enum member, so a raw count or a raw message cannot get out
 *     even under a key that happens to be allowed.
