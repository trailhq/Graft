/**
 * The telemetry contract: the complete, machine-enforced list of what graft may
 * send. `TELEMETRY.md` is the same list in prose, and the two are kept in
 * lockstep — an event or property that is not in this file cannot be sent, and
 * one that is not in `TELEMETRY.md` must not be added here.
 *
 * Why an allowlist rather than a review rule: every telemetry incident in the
 * tools we studied came from a call site quietly adding a property nobody
 * audited. `track()` (track.ts) drops unknown events and unknown keys instead of
 * trusting its callers, so a future `track('query', { path })` sends `query`
 * with no `path` rather than leaking one. The blast radius of a careless call
 * site is "we lose a metric", never "we received someone's source tree".
 *
 * The other half of that guarantee is the value side: every number crosses as a
 * BUCKET and every string as a member of a fixed union. A raw file count plus a
 * language set starts to fingerprint a specific repo; `"100-500"` does not. A
 * raw error message is a path, a symbol, and sometimes a snippet of code; an
 * enum member is not.
 *
 * This module is pure — no I/O, no config, no clock. It is the file a reviewer
 * (or a suspicious user, since the repo is public) reads to verify the claim.
