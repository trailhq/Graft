/**
 * The one-time disclosure, and the `graft telemetry` command's output.
 *
 * The notice is the whole reason this design is defensible. Every telemetry
 * backlash in the tools we looked at — the GitHub CLI's silent 2.91.0 rollout,
 * Gatsby's on-by-default addition, the .NET SDK's opt-out that distributors now
 * patch out — was about a tool that started sending without saying so. Homebrew
 * does exactly what is done here and is uncontroversial: print once, in plain
 * language, before anything leaves, and say how to turn it off in the same
 * breath.
 *
 * Once per MACHINE, not per repo: a dev with twelve checkouts should read this
 * one time. `graft init`'s picker is the other disclosure surface, for the users
 * who see it — this catches everyone else.
