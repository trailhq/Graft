/**
 * The one network call in graft that is not an LLM request.
 *
 * A single POST of the whole queued batch to PostHog's capture endpoint, with
 * `fetch` and no SDK. `posthog-node` would be the conventional choice, but it is
 * a runtime dependency in a CLI whose install weight users notice, it wants to
 * own batching and flushing (both of which the queue already does, and does
 * differently because we are a short-lived process), and "an analytics library
 * that can see everything" is precisely the objection this whole design exists
 * to disarm. Twenty lines of `fetch` is auditable in a sitting.
 *
 * `$process_person_profile: false` on every event is what makes these ANONYMOUS
 * events in PostHog: no person profile is created, no identity is stored, and
 * the `distinct_id` is only ever the random install UUID.
