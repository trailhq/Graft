/**
 * Assembles the viz-facing JSON for the context graph: reads every `.md` node
 * file in a context dir (frontmatter = node + edges) and produces a single
 * `{meta, nodes, edges}` document the viewer can render directly.
 *
 * Design rules (see docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-15-graft-viz-design.md):
 *  - relations are normalized into the closed verb vocabulary — vague LLM
 *    softeners map to the concrete verb they usually mean
 *  - edges whose target slug doesn't exist are dropped (LLM output can dangle)
 *  - a node file with unparseable frontmatter is skipped, never fatal
 *  - both drop counts are reported in `meta` so the UI can say so
