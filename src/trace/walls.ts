/**
 * The wall catalog (design 4.10): seven errors that a command keeps hitting
 * on a machine for reasons outside the code, each with the fix a person
 * wrote, appended to the agent's context when the error comes back.
 *
 * A class matches only on its own line-anchored patterns, in the first and
 * last 4 KB of the result, never inside quoted or JSON-escaped output (D147:
 * a printed record of another session), and (for four classes) only when a segment of the
 * command runs the program the error belongs to (R28): a log printed by
 * `cat`, or an `echo` an agent writes, matches nothing.
 *
 * The fix texts are constants. Nothing from the command's output reaches
 * them; the only value put in is the remote's SSH address, rebuilt from its
 * https URL and checked. They read as information about the failed command
 * (D88): Trail is the tool the person installed, this is the error it knows,
 * and this command usually fixes it, because. They never tell the agent what
 * to say.
 *
 * Pure. Not on the PreToolUse fast path.
