/**
 * Self-maintenance: keeping an installed graft, and the wiring it wrote, current.
 *
 * Two independent kinds of staleness, both invisible to the user today:
 *
 *   1. **Binary staleness** — they installed once and never upgraded. `graft
 *      version` would tell them, but nobody runs it. So we keep a cached,
 *      machine-global registry answer and let every entry point surface a
 *      one-line nudge from it.
 *
 *   2. **Wiring staleness** — `graft init` copies hooks, shims, skill text and
 *      rule files INTO the repo. `npm i -g` replaces the binary but touches none
 *      of them, so a repo wired by 0.7 keeps 0.7's prompts and 0.7's hook
 *      timeouts forever (see the comment on `promptAskTimeout`, which exists
 *      only to work around exactly this). A version stamp written next to the
 *      graph lets any entry point notice the skew and re-run the writes.
 *
 * Everything here is fail-soft by construction: it runs inside hooks and inside
 * the MCP server's boot path, where a throw is a broken session, and it must
 * never block on the network — the registry is only ever read from cache, and
 * the refresh happens in a detached child.
 *
 * Called from all three hosts' entry points so no editor is left out:
 *   • Claude Code   — `session-start` hook (src/claude/hooks.ts)
 *   • Cursor/Codex  — MCP server boot (src/mcp/server.ts), and any CLI command
