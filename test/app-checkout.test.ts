/**
 * Getting a pull request onto disk.
 *
 * The ref names are the fiddly part and the easiest to get silently wrong:
 * `refs/pull/N/merge` is GitHub's own merge of the PR into its base — what will
 * actually land — and reviewing the head branch instead would report a radius
 * for code that was never going to exist. A local bare repository stands in for
 * GitHub here, so this exercises the real git commands with no network.
 *
 * The other half of these tests is the closed pull request, where GitHub has
 * deleted `refs/pull/N/merge` and `refs/pull/N/head` is all that is left. What
 * has to be checked there is not that the fetch succeeds — it is that the diff
 * is still the pull request's own change, because the obvious implementation
 * (diff the head against the base tip) reports NOTHING for a PR that merged as a
 * merge commit, and an empty blast radius posted confidently is worse than the
 * fetch error it replaced.
