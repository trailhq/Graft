/**
 * #127, at the process boundary: `graft build --deep` against a provider that
 * rejects every call must EXIT NON-ZERO and say the meaning tier is incomplete.
 *
 * The reported case was an 884-file repo behind a gateway with a hard token quota:
 * 1,617 files failed with 429, the build printed its normal success footer, and
 * exited 0 — so the degradation was only discovered days later through bad `ask`
 * results. A local server standing in for that gateway is the only way to pin the
 * exit code down, since the failure lives in the CLI's reporting, not in a unit.
