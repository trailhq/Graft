const EXPORT = `Here are my memories of you, written out verbatim:

**Work context**

The user builds the shop API in TypeScript and deploys it with npm run release. They keep PRs small, e.g. under 300 lines.

**Personal context**

The user lives in Pune and trains for a half marathon on weekends.

**Top of mind**

- [2026-10-02] Their partner's birthday is on Friday, and the test for it is a cake.
- [2026-10-12] Retries in src/retry.ts stay at 4 because the
  gateway times out after 30 seconds.
- The staging deploy reads AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=AKIAABCDEFGHIJKLMNOP from the env file.
- They enjoy hiking.
