/**
 * Tests for Java extraction in the Tier-1 code graph. Builds a small Java source
 * tree in a temp dir and asserts the emitted nodes (classes, interfaces, enums,
 * records, methods, constructors) and edges (calls, heritage, package imports)
 * match the AST walk in extract.ts.
 *
 * Three of these pin decisions that are Java-specific and easy to regress, because
 * each one is invisible to the other languages' fixtures:
 *
 *   - `method_invocation` has NO `function` field (it splits the callee into
 *     `object` + `name`), unlike every other grammar graft parses.
 *   - Java has no free functions, so an implicit-`this` call (`decorate(x)`) is a
 *     METHOD call. Resolved against the function index it would vanish — and it is
 *     the most common intra-class edge there is.
 *   - `new Foo()` targets a TYPE, so a constructor call resolved against the
 *     function index would vanish too.
