/**
 * Kotlin construction as a call edge (#387).
 *
 * The depth tier already extracts `Mailer(host = "smtp")` correctly — it is a
 * `call_expression`, exactly like `helperFn(1)`. What was missing sat one step
 * later: resolution matched a bare Kotlin call against functions only, so every
 * constructor edge died on a name the function index does not hold, and a class
 * reported `no indexed callers` while the free function declared beside it in the
 * same file reported all of them.
 *
 * That gap is not evenly distributed. Kotlin services are classes, wired by
 * constructor injection, so on a DI-heavy backend the classes carry most of the
 * coupling and the free functions carry the least — which is precisely backwards
 * from what the graph could see. Measured on a 717-file Kotlin monorepo: one
 * `callers` query on a helper function returned 51 call sites; the service class
 * its routes and integration test are built around returned none.
 *
 * What these pin:
 *  - the edge itself, and that it lands on the class rather than anything else;
 *  - that it stays a FALLBACK — a real function call resolves first, as before;
 *  - that construction inside a class body (a test method, a DI module) resolves
 *    too, since that is where the real instantiations live;
 *  - the two things it must still refuse: a qualified spelling, and a same-named
 *    class in another language's half of a monorepo.
