/**
 * `-e` extension validation (#98): a `graft build -e "<ext>"` must not silently index
 * nothing — the CLI warns on any extension no parser claims. These test the pure helper
 * the warning is built on: the supported set (depth + breadth + container) and which
 * inputs fall outside it, including normalization (leading dot optional, case-insensitive).
 *
 * `.vue` was the extension originally reported in #98 and is used below as a
 * SUPPORTED case: the container tier now claims it (#97). The unsupported side is
 * carried by `.svelte`, which is the same SFC shape and the natural next request —
 * the day someone adds it, this file is where the substitution happens again.
