/**
 * fix-lab5: the relay's "show the list as written", firmer and in D101's shape. In the 1b lab an agent waited for
 * the answer but reworded the list (bold names, a dash, "candidate skill" for a guardrail). The line now says what to
 * keep as it is (each line's number, name and kind) and why (the numbers the person types point at those lines),
 * with no order to recite or say anything word for word (D101, D115). Made-up items.
