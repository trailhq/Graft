## Decided
- To check the nudge in a real Claude session without touching the machine's trail: install trail with `npm i -g --prefix <sandbox>/npm`, clone the repo into the sandbox, run `trail init --agents claude` with `HOME=<sandbox>/home`, then run `claude -p` in the clone with `TRAIL_HOME=<sandbox>/home/.trail`, `PATH=<sandbox>/npm/bin:$PATH`, `TRAIL_CLOUD=1`, `--setting-sources project,local --settings <sandbox>/home/.claude/settings.json` and `--output-format stream-json --verbose`.
- Verified on a repo with 9 learnings: Claude ran `trail ask` first, got the nudge, and ended its answer with the link word for word, and the link's claim answered pending.

## Tried and ruled out
- `HOME=<sandbox>` or `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR=<sandbox>` for the claude run: "Not logged in". The macOS login doesn't follow either, so keep the real HOME for claude and isolate trail with TRAIL_HOME and `--setting-sources` instead.

## Watch out
- After a heavy reading turn the Stop hook asks Claude about saving a learning, so the answer with the link is followed by a second short message, and the UI shows "Stop hook error occurred". In a demo the link isn't the last thing on screen.
- In a repo that commits trail's SessionStart hook, init also adds a global one, so the trail context is injected twice.
