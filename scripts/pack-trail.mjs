/**
 * Lays out the `@trailhq/trail` package from this repo's build, in build/trail/.
 *
 * trail and graft are one program under two names, published as two packages
 * from the same `dist/`:
 *
 *   @trailhq/trail   bin: trail  →  dist/bin/trail.js
 *   @nanonets/graft  bin: graft  →  dist/bin/graft.js   (this repo's package.json)
 *
 * Each package ships exactly one command, so installing both never clashes on
 * a bin name, and `graft upgrade` installs both. @nanonets/graft stays a full
 * package rather than a pointer: the hook shims committed in thousands of repos
 * resolve `@nanonets/graft/dist/claude/*` by path, and 78% of active installs
 * are on versions older than the one that knows about trail.
 *
 * Usage, after `npm run build` (and the telemetry key stamp, when publishing):
 *   node scripts/pack-trail.mjs
 *   npm publish build/trail --access public
